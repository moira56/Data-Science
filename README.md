# New York City Taxi Fare Prediction

## Project Overview
This project analyzes taxi trip data from New York City and aims to predict taxi fares based on various trip characteristics. The dataset used is **New York City Taxi Trips 2019**, available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dhruvildave/new-york-city-taxi-trips-2019/data). 

## Objectives
- Predict taxi fare prices (regression task).
- Classify trips into predefined fare categories (classification task).
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify patterns.
- Compare different machine learning models.
- Investigate clustering techniques for trip segmentation.

## Methodology

### Phase 1: Data Analysis and Preparation
- **Problem Definition:** Identifying key factors influencing taxi fares.
- **Data Cleaning:** Handling missing values, removing outliers, normalization.
- **Feature Engineering:** Creating additional features like trip duration, time of day, and geospatial features.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualization of data distributions, correlation analysis.
- **Dimensionality Reduction:** Applying PCA and UMAP.
- **Hypothesis Testing:** Formulating and testing statistical hypotheses.

### Phase 2: Machine Learning Implementation
- **Model Building:** 
  - Implementing k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN) from scratch using NumPy.
  - Training at least two supervised learning models using `sklearn`.
  - Applying ensemble models (bagging and boosting).
  - Developing a deep learning model using TensorFlow or PyTorch.
  - Clustering analysis using at least two clustering algorithms.
- **Model Evaluation:** Comparing models using RMSE, accuracy, and F1-score.
- **Operationalization:** Documenting findings and discussing deployment strategies.
