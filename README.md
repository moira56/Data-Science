# New York City Taxi Fare Prediction

## Overview
This project aims to predict taxi fare amounts in New York City using machine learning techniques. The dataset includes taxi trip records, such as pickup/drop-off locations, timestamps, passenger counts, trip distances, and fare amounts. 

## Objectives
- Predict taxi fare amounts using regression models.
- Classify trips into predefined fare categories.
- Analyze ride patterns across geography and time.
- Perform feature engineering to improve predictive performance.
- Compare different machine learning models and evaluate their effectiveness.

## Dataset
- **Source:** [Kaggle - NYC Taxi Trips 2019](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dhruvildave/new-york-city-taxi-trips-2019/data)
- **Features:**
  - `tpep_pickup_datetime`, `tpep_dropoff_datetime` (timestamp features)
  - `trip_distance`, `trip_duration`
  - `fare_amount`, `passenger_count`
  - `PULocationID`, `DOLocationID`, `RateCodeID`, `payment_type`
  
## Methodology
### Data Preprocessing
- Handle missing values and filter out invalid data.
- Parse datetime fields to extract temporal features.
- Normalize and standardize numerical features.
- Encode categorical variables for model training.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Visualize trip distributions using histograms and boxplots.
- Identify correlations using heatmaps and scatter plots.
- Perform dimensionality reduction (PCA, UMAP) to uncover patterns.

### Feature Engineering
- Extract features like `trip_duration`, `average_speed`, `hour_of_day`, `day_of_week`.
- Categorize pickup times into `Morning`, `Afternoon`, `Evening`, and `Night`.
- One-hot encode pickup/drop-off boroughs.
- Create binary features for Manhattan and airport locations.

### Model Selection
- **Regression:** Linear Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting.
- **Classification:** Logistic Regression, Decision Trees.
- **Clustering:** K-Means, DBSCAN for location-based segmentation.
- **Deep Learning:** Neural network model using TensorFlow/PyTorch.

### Model Evaluation
- Compare performance using RMSE, MAE, and RÂ² scores.
- Perform hyperparameter tuning with GridSearchCV.
- Implement cross-validation for robust evaluation.
